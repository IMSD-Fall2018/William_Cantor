In this projection mapping project, we had four button presses that changed our record player display from one record of
music to another. What we wanted to do was to give a record player display with a jukebox feel. We mapped four audio files
to four buttons. Those four buttons were all mapped to one object. We used severel scripts. We used one for color and 
audio and one for rotation. Please enjoy this amazing projection.
